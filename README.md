# BeatSaber-Overlay
A BeatSaber overlay I have created for my DataPuller mod.
This overlay is easy to use, just open the Index.html file and add the URL to your recording/streaming software of choice (Make sure you have the DataPuller mod installed).

##Options
###Scale:
changes the scale of the UI, the site was designed for 1080p recording/streaming.
E.G. scale=0.8

###beatmap/stats/modifiersVis:
Changes the visibility of the three elements on the overlay.
E.G. beatmapVis=hidden
