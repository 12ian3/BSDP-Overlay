# BeatSaber-Overlay
A BeatSaber overlay I have created for my [DataPuller](https://github.com/kOFReadie/DataPuller/releases) mod.
This overlay is easy to use, just open the [Overlay](https://kofreadie.github.io/BeatSaber-Overlay/) and add the URL to your recording/streaming software of choice (Make sure you have the [DataPuller](https://github.com/kOFReadie/DataPuller/releases) mod installed).

## Options
### Scale:
changes the scale of the UI, the site was designed for 1080p recording/streaming.
E.G. scale=0.8

### Beatmap/stats/modifiersVis:
Changes the visibility of the three elements on the overlay.
E.G. beatmapVis=hidden
